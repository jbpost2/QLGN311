If this is the case, the dominant allele for Huntington disease would remain in the population because the homozygotes are not affected. If the dominant homozygous genotype does cause Huntington disease, then natural selection has caused the genomic frequency to undergo extreme directional selection towards the homozygous recessive. If this is the case, the dominant allele has probably not been eliminated by natural selection because those heterozygotes do not die until after they have reached reproductive age. If they are able to reproduce before they die, the dominant allele will stay in the population. The same principle applies to conditions such as a predisposition to skin cancer. Although someone may get skin cancer and die when they're 50, they have already had a chance to pass those genes on before they die.","UGRD",2191,11014,4,"GN",311,"Agriculture & Life Sciences","Senior",7344,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","CAMP","M",8,"Fall 2019 Census","M","White","11BIOCHBS","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences","Fourth Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Transfer Student",92,2,3,680,4.17,1598,"Tier3","Not First",2019,"NOT enrolled"

Is this population likely to be in HWE? No. This is because the requirement of 'random mating' is not being met; inbreeding, which is sometimes due to low population numbers or constant close proximity to population counterparts, is not random mating, which voids any chance of HWE assumption. Assortive mating would be another situation where HWE cannot be assumed.

B. The expectation of genotype frequencies within this particular population would most likely have higher numbers/higher frequency values for the homozygous dominant or recessive genotypes as compared to the heterozygous genotype for whatever particular locus is being looked at. This explains the 'disruptive selection' assertion above. This difference would become more and more exasperated overtime due to ancestral alleles finding their way into ancestral gametes.

C. Yes, it is true. As aforementioned, based on the increased chance of virtually identical alleles from ancestors making their way into progeny gametes and organisms, a heightened chance of homozygous genotypes for loci results. This causes frequency numbers for homozygous genotypes to increase and heterozygous frequency numbers to decrease, resulting in disruptive selection overtime within a population. ","UGRD",2168,11014,3,"GN",311,"Sciences","Senior",4941,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","BUSN","M",8,"Fall 2019 Census","M","White","17BIOSCBS","College of Sciences","Fourth Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",65,1,3,630,4.79,NA,"Tier3","Not First",2019,"NOT enrolled"

B) The relative expectations of genotype frequencies in cases of inbreeding would tend to favor homozygotes. Genetically-similar individuals will create offspring with identical/similar genetics, so as a result more homozygous offspring are created. 

C) This statement is not true, because the the likelihood of the homozygous genotypes appearing is not due to an increase in fitness of the homozygous individuals, it is due to non-random mating. Disruptive selection is a scenario in which having a homozygous dominant genotype or homozygous recessive genotype makes the organism more likely to survive in its environment. The increase in homozygous individuals from inbreeding is not a result of increased fitness, it is due to a non-random mating situation. ","UGRD",2168,11014,3,"GN",311,"Agriculture & Life Sciences","Senior",4941,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","BUSN","F",8,"Fall 2019 Census","F","White","11ANSCBS","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences","Fourth Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",92,1,3,540,4.66,NA,"Tier3","First Gen",2019,"NOT enrolled"

If disruptive selection is occuring, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium cannot be assumed.

B) When a population undergoes an inbreeding scenario, genotype frequencies can change, but allele frequencies do not change. Since this statement says that disruptive selection is occuring, we can assume that the homozygotic genotypes have a higher fitness when compared to the heterozygotic genotype.

C) This statement is not true. The genotypic array of an inbreeding scenario is not always characterized by disruptive selection. Is it possible for an inbreeding scenario to confer a genotypic array that is characteristic of disruptive selection? YES. But does this always occur in systematic inbreeding schemes?

Even at this point, deletions and duplications can occur in chromosomes causing these lethal alleles to appear. Such as down syndrome which is caused by a trisomy of chromosome 21. A dad two copies of the 21 chromosome and no phenotypic traits, during meiosis a gamete will form with 3 21+ chromosomes causing down syndrome. Diseases that are caused by chromosomal aberrations are not likely to be removed from a population. When random duplications and mutations occur during meiosis or crossing over, this is not able to be stopped. ","UGRD",2168,11014,4,"GN",311,"Agriculture & Life Sciences","Senior",7344,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","CAMP","F",8,"Fall 2019 Census","F","White","11ANSCBS","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences","Fourth Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",26,1,3,600,4.62,NA,"Tier1&2","Not First",2019,"NOT enrolled"

Disruptive selection means both extremes are favored while the heterozygous genotypes have the lowest fitness. Thus, homozygous genotypes (ie. AA or BB) are favored while the heterozygous genotype (ie. AB) has the lowest fitness. Eventually, with disruptive selection, the population will be bimodal and have a genotypic array of pAA+qaa.

If there is systemic inbreeding, then random mating is not occurring. Systemic inbreeding is also common in small populations where there is not a choice, and one of the other conditions of HWE is an infinitely large population.

B) Heterozygous frequencies will drop towards zero and BOTH of the homozygous frequencies will continue to rise. Eventually it would trend towards an entirely homozygous population made up of both the recessive and dominant homozygotes. 

C) It is not true. The genotype frequencies change in systemic inbreeding in the same way as disruptive selection (favoring the homozygotes and selecting against the heterozygotes) but the frequencies are not changing because of fitness or selection. Systemic inbreeding creates this genotype frequency shift due to alleles in reproduction coming from a common ancestor. Two offspring down the pedigree could have received one of their alleles from the same ancestor, and the final sum of this action is the trend of the population to go to AA or aa. ","UGRD",2168,11014,3,"GN",311,"Engineering","Senior",4941,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","BUSN","M",8,"Fall 2019 Census","M","White","14BMHBS","College of Engineering","Fourth Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",49,1,3,760,5,NA,"Tier3","Not First",2019,"NOT enrolled"

Even if the mother had a relative that had albinism and there was a high chance of her passing that recessive allele to her offspring, if her husband had no history of albinism the probability of him having that recessive allele would be much lower.

Since this population is undergoing inbreeding, it is not likely to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 

B. As inbreeding patterns continue within a population, the amount of genetic diversity decreases. Therefore, the population is likely to have a shared trait or set of traits that is more favored, leading more to homozygous nature and less to a heterozygous nature, in which different alleles may come together. This pattern of diversity takes time to develop and depends on the degree of variability. 

C. Yes, this statement is true. Disruptive selection is when the heterozygotes are eventually unfavored, leaning towards one of the homozygous characteristics. In inbreeding, depending on how many members of the population are contributing, can also lead down that path. ","UGRD",2178,11014,4,"GN",311,"Agriculture & Life Sciences","Senior",7344,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","BUSN","F",8,"Fall 2019 Census","F","White","11NTSBS","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences","Fourth Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",41,1,3,NA,5.13,NA,"Tier1&2","Not First",2019,"NOT enrolled"

When inbreeding occurs, the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium equation is altered. The ratios of how a population is in the Hardy-Weinberg equation do not match how the genotypic and allelic frequencies change with inbreeding.

B) The genotypic frequencies within this population should be expected to change. Heterozygotes would increase while homozygotes would decrease. 

C) Yes, it is true because as a population breeds with one another, more heterozygotes will be formed. It's not that only heterozygotes will be formed, it's just that more heterozygotes would form than that of homozygotes. As more and more heterozygotes are formed, their chance of producing a heterozygote offspring will increase. This can be drawn from simply looking at how heterozygotes and homozygotes cross with one another. ","UGRD",2178,11014,4,"GN",311,"Agriculture & Life Sciences","Junior",7344,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","BUSN","M",8,"Fall 2019 Census","M","White","11BIOCHBS","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences","Third Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",73,1,3,NA,4.6,NA,"Tier1&2","Not First",2019,"NOT enrolled"

C) This statement is true. Disruptive selection occurs when organisms who are homozygous dominant or homozygous recessive are most fit for survival.

By the time individuals with the allele for Huntington's have reached that age and begin to show symptoms, they might have already produced progeny - thereby passing on the allele to the next generation. 

In this way, individuals with the single dominant allele for Huntington's disease behave like carriers until they have reached a certain age when they start showing the phenotype of the allele.

Since people with the allele for Huntington's survive to reproduce, natural selection cannot eliminate this gene from the population. Natural selection depends on fitness which is the ability to survive and reproduce. As long as individuals with the Huntington's allele continue to do that, they will be considered fit and have no selection pressure against them because they would have already produced progeny.","UGRD",2178,11014,2,"GN",311,"Sciences","Junior",4940,"E","Principles of Genetics","Halweg,Christopher J","BUSN","F",5,"Fall 2019 Census","F","Asian","17BIOSCBS","College of Sciences","Third Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",239,1,3,690,0,NA,"OutofState_International","Not First",2019,"NOT enrolled"

Benzer would not have been able to map mutant dominant alleles using a complementation approach because it would only take one dominant mutant allele to express a particular genotype and phenotype. This means that a dominant mutation T4 for the locus in the experiment could be homozygous dominant or heterozygous dominant. In a complementation test, the dominant mutant allele's genotype may be expressed regardless of any mutations present in the dominant or recessive alleles for a particular locus of another potentially mutant T4. Recessive mutations must have two mutant recessive alleles to be present and complementing recessive individuals with other recessive individuals does not risk the masking of present or non-present mutations by dominant alleles. If a dominant mutation strain was co-infected with a wildtype strain of T4, the dominant mutation strain would be shown regardless of the wildtype's alleles (assuming the wildtype was recessive and the mutation strain was homozygous dominant).

B. The genotype frequencies would be eventually be homozygous. Every time inbreeding occurs, there will be more and more homozygous individuals.

B. Genotype frequencies do change during inbreeding while allele frequencies do not. Homozygous genotypes would increase in frequency and the heterozygous would decrease.

C. This statement can be considered to be true because during inbreeding, individuals are more likely to be given the same alleles from their parents since they were family members.

For this reason, Benzer would be unable to map dominant mutation types using a complementation as all mutations would appear the same, as each would overcome the wild-type entirely. No conclusive data could have been gathered for dominant mutations if Benzer used the complementation approach.

Its traits would be the only ones evident in testing not the wild-type, just the dominant mutation. A similar masking affect is seen in heterozygous alleles.

First, population genetics factors such as inbreeding and migration can cause the lack of expression of a certain disease as new allele frequencies are introduced or generated. They do not impact the allele frequencies but do change the genotypic frequencies which is what is needed to cause the disease. For example, inbreeding favors homozygotes over heterozygotes. If the disease was present only on heterozygotes, then the frequency of disease would decrease as disruptive selection occurs.

Second, the allele may not be expressed. Due to chromosomal aberrations such as inversions and translocation, the allele may be masked or produce an nonviable cell. This results in particular genotypes to not even be brought into the population.

Finally, biologically, the body has many mechanisms and cell check points that can fix the proteins generated by the 'diseased' allele. Therefore, even if the human had the allele, it may not be expressed causing there to be a lower frequency of disease in population.","UGRD",2178,11014,3,"GN",311,"Sciences","Senior",4941,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","BUSN","F",2,"Fall 2019 Census","F","Unknown","17BIOSCBS","College of Sciences","Fourth Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",60,1,3,NA,5,NA,"Tier3","Not First",2019,"NOT enrolled"

The population is likely to be in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. 

B. The relative expectations of genotype frequency would be towards the homozygous individuals. For instance, with systematic inbreeding, the frequency of specific homozygous alleles will be more present in the gene population depending on the genotypes of the initial population. Therefore, your p and q values would be inversely related, therefore favoring the homozygous individuals, Depending on the phenotype of the original population, with inbreeding, those alleles become more common in the gene pool and will therefore be more common within the population, favoring p OR q. 

C. No this statement isn't true. For instance, when you have inbreeding in a population, specific genotypes are more frequent and the population begins to favor homozygous individuals over heterozygous individuals. With inbreeding, the outcome is almost exactly similar genotypes and phenotypes of the previous generation, therefore, when crossing those closely linked to each other genetically the more common it is to see homozygous individuals of either the dominant or recessive kind. This kind of selection is more like directional selection than disruptive selection since the pattern of genes is leading the entire population to have a more uniform genotype in either the recessive, or dominant direction. ","UGRD",2178,11014,2,"GN",311,"Agriculture & Life Sciences","Junior",4940,"E","Principles of Genetics","Halweg,Christopher J","CAMP","F",8,"Fall 2019 Census","F","White","11ANSCBS","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences","Third Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",129,1,3,NA,4.1,NA,"OutofState_International","Not First",2019,"NOT enrolled"

B. Inbreeding causes an increase in homozygotes within the population and changes the genotypic frequency, but not the allele frequency. Over time, all the individuals in the population will be homozygous and the genotypic frequency/array will be pAA + qaa, with possible genotypes AA and aa.

Another example of a mutation are inversions. The two main types of inversions are paracentric, meaning the mutation occurs elsewhere of the centromere. The other main form of an inversion is pericentric which means that the mutation occurs with the inclusion of the centromere.

A population that is undergoing systematic inbreeding would not be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium because mating is not random, but rather limited to matches between related individuals.

B. Systematic inbreeding will cause higher frequencies of homozygous genotypes because ancestral alleles are more likely to be paired and passed on in increasing frequency with every successive generation produced through inbreeding.

C. The statement that systematic inbreeding is explained by disruptive selection is false. Inbreeding causes there to be more homozygotes, but only one homozygous genotype not both kinds of homozygotes. For example, if the trait were flower color with Red (RR), pink (Rr), and white (rr), inbreeding may cause there to be more white flowers because common ancestors both had that trait and passed the alleles. It would not cause there to be both more red and white flowers, but only more white.

Inbreeding is a obvious transgression of this criteria.

B) In any cases of systematic inbreeding, one should expect that homozygous genes are favored and will ultimately reign supreme. Heterozygous traits tend to be significantly less common than homozygous traits in inbreeding scenarios.

C) I would argue that it isn't, as disruptive selection is characterized by a bimodel graph in the population.  This would mean that while the heterozygous traits are the least common, both types of homozygous traits (AA and aa, for example), are about equally abundant. However, in the terms of inbreeding, as there is only a select few genes to be chosen from the limited gene pool, this would lead me to expect that only one type of homozygous trait (AA, for example), would be favored, as the ancestors had passed down *that specific* gene in the population.  In this sense, directional selection is a better representation for this inbreeding scenario.","UGRD",2188,11014,3,"GN",311,"Sciences","Sophomore",4941,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","CAMP","M",5,"Fall 2019 Census","M","Asian","17BIOSCBS","College of Sciences","Second Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",92,1,3,NA,4.59,NA,"Tier3","Not First",2019,"NOT enrolled"

B) In disruptive selection, heterozygous organisms are selected against. Thus, heterozygous organisms will have a lower relative fitness compared to homozygous organisms, and will be selected against. Due to inbreeding, the alleles possessed by common ancestors are often shared between inbreeding organisms, and progeny can have two copies of an identical allele from their common ancestor, even if this allele would normally be rare in the general population.

C) This statement is untrue, as though inbreeding may allow progeny two have two copies of otherwise rare alleles, it does not involve selection against certain phenotypes.

This change in frequencies will result in disruptive selection occurring. ","NDS",2198,11014,2,"GN",311,"Undesignated or Exchange","Unclassif",4940,"E","Principles of Genetics","Halweg,Christopher J","OTHR","F",1,"Fall 2019 Census","F","Non-Resident Alien","11SAB","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences","Unclassified","Unclassified",8,"New Student",1,"New Student",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",2019,"NOT enrolled"

B. In general, the relative expectation of the genotype frequency is for the heterozygous genotype to eventually dwindle while one of the homozygous traits dominates.

C. I don't think this statement is true. The frequency for systematic inbreeding can be explained by directional selection. Usually one of the homozygous traits will become more prevalent in the population causing the other to significantly decrease along with the heterozygous genotype.

No, in Hardy-Weinberg you would not expect to see inbreeding and you would also expect to see a very large population (one of the assumptions) which would make inbreeding difficult to occur in.

B. You expect to see a higher than usual genotype frequency of homozygotes versus heterozygotes due to a particular allele having a higher frequency relative to a normal population.

C. No, you would see directional selection in the population since only one particular allele would have a higher frequency than normal which would cause a higher genotype frequency of homozygotes for that allele.

If two mutations are on the same chromosome, this means they are in the cis configuration and recovery of the wild type phenotype cannot occur. In other words, complementation does not occur in the cis configuration. Complementation tests help map recessive mutations, but if the mutations are dominant, the mutation phenotype would over take any complementation. Dominant mutations are unable to complement, and this is why Benzer was not able to map them using a complementation approach.

No, this population is not likely to be in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. The population is not likely to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium because inbreeding is violating the assumption that random mating is occurring. Inbreeding is not a random mating process. 

B. In general, for a population that is inbreeding, you should expect that the homozygous genotype will predominate over the heterozygous genotype. We see this often when looking at pedigrees of families where inbreeding occurred and often times we may find alleles that are identical by descent (they came from the same ancestor). This is supporting evidence that eventually with so many of the same alleles being shared the homozygous genotype will predominate over time. 

C. Yes this statement is true. When inbreeding occurs in a population the homozygous genotypes begin to predominate over the heterozygous genotypes. Eventually, the population will shift so that only the homozygous condition is predominating and offspring will have alleles that are identical by descent. In class we saw the example of this with Old Gray Guy, a wolf in a population where eventually ~53% of the population's alleles belonged so a single male wolf. So many wolves were homozygous that this became lethal to the population. ","UGRD",2178,11014,4,"GN",311,"Sciences","Senior",9350,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","CAMP","F",6,"Spring 2020 Census","F","Black or African American","17BIOSCBS","College of Sciences","Fourth Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",34,1,3,540,5,NA,"Tier1&2","Not First",2020,"NOT enrolled"

The dominant mutation only requires one copy of the gene for the trait to be expressed, so when mixed with a population carrying the dominant allele it becomes nearly impossible to tell which if either had a mutation at one locus. In most complementation studies, because the trait being examined is recessive, it requires that both strains of bacteriophages carry the defective gene, so that one cannot spread the gene via conjugation to that other.  The only type of complementation that shows a mutant phenotype are when trans alleles (so on both of the two copies of a gene on a chromosomes) are both mutated. In all other cases either another gene/locus, or the other chromosome compensate for the mutation, which is what would occur if a dominant mutation was mixed with wildtype bacteriophages. For example if a bacteria has one copy of a gene that allows for normal cell function, but the gene on the homologous chromosome were mutated, that bacteria would likely be fine if it only needs one copy of the gene to function and the mutation were recessive. ","UGRD",2178,11014,4,"GN",311,"Sciences","Senior",9350,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","BUSN","F",9,"Spring 2020 Census","F","Two or More Races","17BIOSCBS","College of Sciences","Fourth Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",29,1,3,NA,4.89,NA,"Tier1&2","First Gen",2020,"NOT enrolled"

No, it is not likely in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. The requirements for HW is that it must be a large population sample and we are not given a sample size so we have no way of determining this. There also must be no mutation or gene flow occurring to be in HW equilibrium. If this population is undergoing disruptive selection, that means that the genotypic frequencies are changing and the homozygotes are being favored which means gene flow is occurring. There also must be no migration to be in HW Equilibrium and we are not sure if this is occurring with the limited amount of information we are given. 

B. If this population was undergoing disruptive selection then the expected genotypic frequencies would be a favoring towards the homozygotes, or increased frequency, and a decline from the level of heterozygotes, or decreased frequency. Typically in populations that undergo systemic inbreeding this type of frequency layout is observed. As more and more generations breed and reproduce, a favoring for the two respective homozygous alleles are favored and a strong decline in the frequency of the heterozygous allele results. This can sometimes prove bad for the organisms in this population if they are suddenly exposed to a new population with different genotype frequencies. 

C. Yes, I believe this statement is true. As I stated this type of selection has been observed among inbreeding populations. Of course, there are always so many variables at play that one may not be able to definitively say that the genotypic frequencies in this population is explained solely by disruptive selection but observations and experiments conducted before have supported these conclusions. ","UGRD",2181,11014,3,"GN",311,"Agriculture & Life Sciences","Junior",5814,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","BUSN","F",8,"Spring 2020 Census","F","White","11NTSBS","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences","Third Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",11,1,3,NA,4.79,NA,"Tier3","Not First",2020,"NOT enrolled"

No because it violates the rule of 'no inbreeding within the population' and thus likely cannot be at equilibrium.

2. The population will favor homozygous genotypes over time, diminishing the number of heterozygotes considerably.

3. This statement is true because as the population continues to inbreed, the distribution of allele frequencies will favor the homozygotes. Disruptive selection sees an increase in the two homozygote genotypes, with a deficit in the heterozygotes, as we see in this population.  ","UGRD",2178,11014,3,"GN",311,"Agriculture & Life Sciences","Junior",5814,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","CAMP","F",8,"Spring 2020 Census","F","White","11NTSBS","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences","Third Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",51,1,3,NA,4.66,NA,"Tier3","Not First",2020,"NOT enrolled"

For a population to be in Hardy-Weinberg, it must satisfy the five assumptions: infinite population, random mating, no selection, no mutation, and no migration, and this population does not meet the requirements. Because there is no diversity in genotypes, when inbreeding occurs, the heterozygotes will be at a disadvantage, and the homologues will increase. I believe the statement it false because if inbreeding occurs, only one genotype is being passed down, which can be explained by directional selection, so I think only on homologue will be at an advantage.","UGRD",2178,11014,3,"GN",311,"Agriculture & Life Sciences","Senior",5814,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","CAMP","F",5,"Spring 2020 Census","F","Asian","11ANSCBS","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences","Fourth Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",92,1,3,640,4.75,NA,"Tier3","Not First",2020,"NOT enrolled"

The frequency of allele is not the sole predictor of developing of a disease, as many alleles can be masked by a dominant allele that is not diseased. For example this is why autosomal recessive genetic diseases are less frequent than are those that follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Therefore, an individual who is a carrier for a genetic disease can have children with a normal individual and hypothetically could produce all normal children.

The frequency of offspring in the F2 with ebony bodies is 0.5000. I got this since the ebony locus is on a different chromosome than the eye-wing one, so there is only a 50% chance of having either a normal body (Ee) or an ebony body (ee).

B The frequency of offspring in the F2 with Bar eyes, normal wings is 0.1070. Since these are on the same chromosome, I used the map distance provided to calculate the frequency. The frequency of getting bar eyes, normal wings BW is 0.214, so I multiplied it by half to get the frequency. 0.214 x 0.5 = 0.1070.

C. The frequency of offspring in the F2 with Bar eyes, normal wings, and ebony bodies is 0.0268. Since the bar eyes and normal wings locus are on one chromosome and ebony body is on another chromosome, I just multiplied the two together. From the previous part, I calculated that the frequency of bar eyes, normal wings BW is 0.1070. I also already calculated the frequency of ebony body as 0.5000. So, I just multiplied the two together to get my answer as 0.0268. The work: 0.1070 x 0.5000 = 0.02675 which I rounded to 0.0268 (four decimal places).

Overtime natural selection has not been able to eliminate this gene because these random mutations keep happening, giving individuals Huntington's even when there is no ancestral history of it in their family. Furthermore, research has shown that Huntington's can act as a prevention to certain types of cancer and other diseases, thus proving advantageous in the eyes of natural selection.

No, this population is not likely to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium because there is systematic inbreeding occurring, so the assumption that there is random mating is violated. Because one of the assumptions for the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium is violated, the population is not likely to be in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. 

B. Because there is systematic inbreeding occurring, heterozygotes will eventually no longer be in the population. This means the number of homozygous individuals will grow larger and larger until hererozygous individuals have been completely eliminated. There is also a much higher chance of mutations occurring. Because there is a smalled gene pool, mutations will be more likely and there will be less genetic variance.

This population is likely NOT in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. One of the requirements to be in HW equilibrium is that the population is undergoing random mating. A population subjected to systematic inbreeding is not doing random mating and therefore cannot be in HW equilibrium.

B. The relative expectations of genotype frequencies for a population with disruptive selection would be visualized by a frequency graph that is bimodal. This means that the relative frequency distribution is going to have two peaks on opposite ends. This is because the homozygotes are favored leaving a trough in the middle where the heterozygote is. With that being said, you would expect to see many more homozygotes than the heterozygotes in this population. 

C. This statement is true. When inbreeding occurs, individuals are mated with people from within their family. Individuals within a family likely share many alleles. When mated, if these two individuals from within the same family that have many alleles in common create a progeny, that progeny is likely to be homozygous for many traits because there is a greater chance that the same alleles are being passed from both parents (because there is a greater chance that parents have the same allele not because one allele has better chance of being passed than another).

When carrying out a complementation test for recessive mutations, it is clear when it is the recessive mutation because for it to occur you need a homozygous recessive allele (2 of them). Whereas with dominant mutations, it can either be homozygous for the mutation or heterozygous so more tests and crosses are needed to determine it. When carrying out a complementation test with dominant mutations the outcome is different than with recessive mutations because you only need one mutation in the gene to be able to observe the mutation. In recessive mutations if there is one copy of the mutant it won't be observed because it would be complemented by the dominant mutant allele, to observe the recessive mutation you would need two recessive copies in the same gene where they are unable to complement each other.  If a dominant mutation strain was co-infected with a wildtype strain of T4, some prophages would persist while others would be inviable. This is because the wildtype strain would offer media for the dominant mutation to survive on. Since there are several variations of a strain and a mutation, some strains would persist and we can see what each strain had or was lacking by comparing it to the 'master strain'. ","UGRD",2188,11014,2,"GN",311,"Agriculture & Life Sciences","Sophomore",5428,"E","Principles of Genetics","Halweg,Christopher J","CAMP","F",8,"Spring 2020 Census","F","White","24EXPLST","University College","Second Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",90,1,3,NA,4.56,NA,"Tier3","Not First",2020,"NOT enrolled"

For example, if a diploid cell undergoing meiosis has a nondisjunction, this will result in gametes with too many or few chromosomes. A monosomy (gamete with only one copy of the chromosome) cannot survive as it doesn't have homologous chromosomes and may be missing important genetic information. A trisomy could result, which is more likely to function as a viable gamete (because it is not missing any genetic information, they just have extra). However, the extra chromosome makes it harder for the gamete to be viable. Thus it is not likely that the gamete with the trisomy (ex. trisomy 21, which will cause down's syndrome) will survive to birth and show the phenotype of down's syndrome. 

Another example of this is the position effect, which is seen in burketts leukemia. In this disease, 2 alleles (an oncogene and an allele that codes for B cells) must be positioned close to each other, which causes the oncogene to start uncontrollable B cell division. However, these are normal alleles in the population (high frequency) but the frequency of this disease is much smaller since these alleles are often not found next to each other. ","UGRD",2188,11014,3,"GN",311,"Sciences","Junior",5814,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","CAMP","F",8,"Spring 2020 Census","F","White","17BIOSCBS","College of Sciences","Third Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",49,1,3,NA,5,NA,"Tier3","Not First",2020,"NOT enrolled"

B. This population should have much less heterozygotes over time than a non inbreeding population because the offspring are more likely to be carriers for the same genes and mating within their own lineage makes it more likely that those genes get paired up making homozygous offspring. Thus their should be much higher frequencies of homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive genotypes while having low rates of heterozygous offspring.

C. The statement is true because in disruptive selection the genotypic frequencies migrate to both homozygous genotypes and decrease the amount of heterozygotes. This is what should happen in a population with a lot of inbreeding because carriers for the same traits are more likely to be paired and produce homozygotes than if a mate was introduced from a different lineage.","UGRD",2188,11014,2,"GN",311,"Sciences","Junior",5428,"E","Principles of Genetics","Halweg,Christopher J","CAMP","F",8,"Spring 2020 Census","F","White","17MBIOBS","College of Sciences","Third Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",60,1,3,NA,4.52,NA,"Tier3","Not First",2020,"NOT enrolled"

This population is not likely to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This population is going through systematic inbreeding. Therefore, it is not random mating which is a requirement for it be be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 

B.) The relative expectations of the genotype frequencies in this population would follow that of disruptive selection. There would be higher numbers of frequencies in each of the homozygous genotypes but not as much of the heterozygous genotypes. The graph of this would be bimodal with the peaks near each of the two ends of the graph and a ""dip"" in the middle to express that the numbers are higher in each end (the homozygous genotypes) and not as much in the middle (heterozygous genotype). 

C.) This statement is true. With inbreeding, the resulting progenies are expected to be more homozygous. Many of the recessive homozygous genotypes will start to emerge and increase. The dominant allele will also start to become more homozygous as opposed to heterozygous as inbreeding continues. The disruptive selection explanation is reasonable as the population is becoming more favored to the two homozygous traits. ","UGRD",2188,11014,2,"GN",311,"Sciences","Junior",5428,"E","Principles of Genetics","Halweg,Christopher J","BUSN","F",5,"Spring 2020 Census","F","Asian","17BIOSCBS","College of Sciences","Third Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",92,1,3,640,4.75,NA,"Tier3","Not First",2020,"NOT enrolled"

C. This statement is true because inbreeding keeps recessive alleles in the population. Over time, more and more homozygotes will appear.

No! they could not  be Hardy-Weinberg because inbreeding increases mutations in offspring and is a small population which violates the laws.

B.) The hetero genes would be at a more disadvantage to survive meaning that it would be less likely to have offspring that would thrive because it's fitness would be so low. While the homo genes would thrive with a more generic phenotype population but the offspring would eventually develop recessive genetic disorders. 

C.) True, because if they are disruptive that means that that the HETEROZYGOUS allele would be less likely to survive due to low fitness compared to the homozygous and when inbreeding happens it decreases genetic diversity in the population making it harder to produce viable offspring but some will be born completely normal to keep breeding.","UGRD",2188,11014,2,"GN",311,"Agriculture & Life Sciences","Sophomore",5428,"E","Principles of Genetics","Halweg,Christopher J","CAMP","F",3,"Spring 2020 Census","F","Hispanic","11NTSBS","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences","Second Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",26,1,3,NA,4.61,NA,"Tier1&2","Not First",2020,"NOT enrolled"

The homozygous recessive traits are easy to prove because there is no variable/question about the genotype of the bacteriophage.  The complimentation approach could backfire due to not knowing if the bacteriophage is a homozygous dominant genotype or a heterozygous genotype. 

These complimentation studies prove that recessive mutations are easier to deal with than dominant mutations because you know the complimentation to a recessive gene but there is no way of knowing the genotype of a dominant mutation without doing a lot of testing (not around at Benzer's time, also really expensive). Recessive is cheaper, easier, and less problamatic (less room for mistakes) than dominant mutations. 

 If a dominant genotype is co-infected, it may not show it (because that infection would be recessive to the phenotype of the dominant gene) and can therefore screw up the results making it a failed experiment.   ","UGRD",2188,11014,1,"GN",311,"Agriculture & Life Sciences","Junior",4429,"E","Principles of Genetics","Halweg,Christopher J","CAMP","F",8,"Spring 2020 Census","F","White","11ANSCBS","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences","Third Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",131,1,3,NA,3.85,NA,"OutofState_International","Not First",2020,"NOT enrolled"

The statement that this population can be explained by disruptive selection is true as inbreeding individuals have alleles in common from a recent ancestor and are thus more likely to produce homozygote offspring and disruptive selection can be desribed as selection towards both homozygote conditions. Inbreeding is a form of mating selection and affects only genotypic frequencies and not allelic frequencies as it affects the way alleles come together. This can be observed in the equation that takes into account the coefficient of inbreeding as while the amount of heterozygotes are decreasing by a factor of 1-F, both homozygote frequencies are increasing by a factor of F relative to pq.

The purpose of these tests were to determine which mutant strains were unable to complement each other and therefore unable to reproduce due to their mutation, meaning their mutation was in the same gene. These recessive mutations that did not complement each other were easily identified because the wildtype would prevail in any case where complementation occurred. If the same experiment were to be done with dominant mutations, the results would not be useful. The presence of the recessive wildtype allele in the case of a dominant mutation would not mask the mutation. In the same way, if two strains were responsible for the same mutation it would be unclear because of the dominant nature. The presence of the wildtype allele in conjunction with the dominant mutation would not mask the mutation and therefore defeats the purpose of the experiment. There would be no discovery of linkage between strains in this case because two wildtype alleles would be required to provide a product with no mutation. In the case of a recessive mutation, the wildtype would mask the mutation and in that way the researcher would know that the strains were not linked. If there were two recessive mutated alleles, then the researcher would know that the strains were linked. If a dominant mutation strain was infected with a wildtype strain of T4, the resulting cross would provide an outcome that looked identical to the dominant mutation strain because the dominant mutation would mask the wildtype phenotype.  ","UGRD",2198,11014,2,"GN",311,"Agriculture & Life Sciences","Sophomore",5428,"E","Principles of Genetics","Halweg,Christopher J","BUSN","F",8,"Spring 2020 Census","F","White","11LSFY","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences","Second Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Student",144,1,3,NA,4.52,NA,"OutofState_International","Unknown",2020,"NOT enrolled"

The mutation could have been dominant in different genes, therefore complementation would have been active, and the wild type would have been expressed. The outcomes of complemenation studies with recessive mutations versus dominant mutations are that recessive mutations tend to always be expressed due to complementation studies occurring between a wild type genotype and a mutant genotype. If the wild type is a carrier, then it could be a carrier on the same allele that the mutation is mutated on, therefore expressing the mutation genotype/phenotype because they are both defective at the same gene.

The greater allele frequency is caused by heteroyzygous individuals having the allele but not expressing the disease.","UGRD",2198,11014,3,"GN",311,"Sciences","Junior",5814,"E","Principles of Genetics","Jones,Whitney Mcrae","CAMP","F",8,"Spring 2020 Census","F","White","17BIOSCBS","College of Sciences","Third Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"Continuing Student",3,"New Transfer Student",92,2,3,NA,5,3425,"Tier3","Not First",2020,"NOT enrolled"

No, this population is not likely to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium because it violates the assumption of an infinitely large population. With inbreeding we can assume that there is a small population, which is causing the organisms in the population to mate with relatives, since mating is supposed to be random.

B.) In general, the relative expectations of genotype frequencies in this population is that the organisms in the population are likely to be homozygous for the same allele type, which is passed down from a common ancestor. 

C.) Yes, the statement is true because disruptive selection would mean that a heterozygous genotype would be less prevalent, compared to homozygous genotypes. With inbreeding, organisms are more likely to be homozygous for an allele than heterozygous.","UGRD",2201,11014,1,"GN",311,"Sciences","Sophomore",4429,"E","Principles of Genetics","Halweg,Christopher J","CAMP","F",8,"Spring 2020 Census","F","White","17LSFY","College of Sciences","Second Year Undergraduate","Bachelor's",3,"New Student",1,"New Student",NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,"","First Gen",2020,"NOT enrolled"
